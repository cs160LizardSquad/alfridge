### Alfridge: UC Berkeley CS160 Final Project 
Created over the course of the Spring 2015 semester by Group L: LIZARD SQUAD.
Our project consists of two parts: one Kinoma Create hardware pin simulator to simulate a smart refrigerator, and the other a mobile companion application written in KinomaJS. To run the project, import both alfridge and alfridgeDevice projects into Kinoma Studio. Run alfridgeDevice using the Kinoma Create simulator, and alfridge using the mobile simulator.
